## Fixes, Features and Changes

Send a pull request. We'll generally want documentation and tests for new features. Tests or documentation on their own are also welcomed. Feel free to ask questions as an issue or on irc (irc.freenode.net, #pil)

- Fork the repo
- Make a branch
- Add your changes + Tests
- Run the test suite. Try to run on both Python 2.x and 3.x, or you'll get tripped up. You can enable Travis-ci on your repo to catch test failures prior to the pull request. 
- Push to your fork, and make a pull request. 

A few guidelines:
- Try to keep any code commits clean and separate from reformatting commits.
- All new code is going to need tests. 

## Bugs

When reporting bugs, please include example code that reproduces the issue, and if possible a problem image. The best reproductions are self contained scripts that pull in as few dependencies as possible. An entire django stack is harder to handle. 

Let us know:
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to happen?
- What actually happened?
- What versions of Pillow and Python are you using?
