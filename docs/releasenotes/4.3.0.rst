Get One Channel From Image
==========================

New method :py:meth:`PIL.Image.Image.getchannel` added.
It returns single channel by index or name. For example,
``image.getchannel("A")`` will return alpha channel as separate image.

Removed Core Image Debugging Code
=================================

Debugging code within ``Image.core.grabclipboard`` was removed. It had been
marked as ``will be removed in future versions`` since PIL. When enabled, it
identified the format of the clipboard data.
