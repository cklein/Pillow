Deprecations
============

FreeType 2.7
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support for FreeType 2.7 is deprecated and will be removed in Pillow 9.0.0 (2022-01-02),
when FreeType 2.8 will be the minimum supported.

We recommend upgrading to at least FreeType `2.10.4`_, which fixed a severe
vulnerability introduced in FreeType 2.6 (:cve:`CVE-2020-15999`).

.. _2.10.4: https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.10.4/

Makefile
^^^^^^^^

The 'install-venv' target has been deprecated.

API Additions
=============

Append images to ICO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When saving an ICO image, the file may contain versions of the image at different
sizes. By default, Pillow will scale down the main image to create these copies.

With this release, a list of images can be provided to the ``append_images`` parameter
when saving, to replace the scaled down versions. This is the same functionality that
already exists for the ICNS format.

Security
========

An out-of-bounds read when saving TIFFs with custom metadata through libtiff has been
fixed.

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

OpenJPEG in the macOS and Linux wheels has been updated from 2.3.1 to 2.4.0, including
security fixes.

Other Changes
=============

Makefile
^^^^^^^^

The 'co' target has been removed.

PyPy wheels
^^^^^^^^^^^

Wheels have been added for PyPy 3.7.

PySide6
^^^^^^^

Support has been added for PySide6. If it is installed, it will be used instead of
PyQt5 or PySide2, since it is based on a newer Qt.
