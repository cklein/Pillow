Deprecations
============

FreeType 2.7
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support for FreeType 2.7 is deprecated and will be removed in Pillow 9.0.0 (2022-01-02),
when FreeType 2.8 will be the minimum supported.

We recommend upgrading to at least FreeType `2.10.4`_, which fixed a severe
vulnerability introduced in FreeType 2.6 (:cve:`CVE-2020-15999`).

.. _2.10.4: https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.10.4/

API Additions
=============

Append images to ICO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When saving an ICO image, the file may contain versions of the image at different
sizes. By default, Pillow will scale down the main image to create these copies.

With this release, a list of images can be provided to the ``append_images`` parameter
when saving, to replace the scaled down versions. This is the same functionality that
already exists for the ICNS format.
