API Additions
=============

ImageOps.colorize
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Previously ``ImageOps.colorize`` only supported two-color mapping with
``black`` and ``white`` arguments being mapped to 0 and 255 respectively.
Now it supports three-color mapping with the optional ``mid`` parameter, and
the positions for all three color arguments can each be optionally specified
(``blackpoint``, ``whitepoint`` and ``midpoint``).
For example, with all optional arguments::
	ImageOps.colorize(im, black=(32, 37, 79), white='white', mid=(59, 101, 175),
                          blackpoint=15, whitepoint=240, midpoint=100)

Curved joints for line sequences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``ImageDraw.Draw.line`` draws a line, or lines, between points. Previously,
when multiple points are given, for a larger ``width``, the joints between
these lines looked unsightly. There is now an additional optional argument,
``joint``, defaulting to ``None``. When it is set to ``curved``, the joints
between the lines will become rounded.
