Backwards Incompatible Changes
==============================

Python 3.4 dropped
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python 3.4 is EOL since 2019-03-16 and no longer supported. We will not be creating
binaries, testing, or retaining compatibility with this version. The final version of
Pillow for Python 3.4 is 5.4.1.

Removed deprecated PIL.OleFileIO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PIL.OleFileIO was removed as a vendored file and in Pillow 4.0.0 (2017-01) in favour of
the upstream olefile Python package, and replaced with an ``ImportError``. The
deprecated file has now been removed from Pillow. If needed, install from PyPI (eg.
``pip install olefile``).

Removed deprecated ImageOps functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several undocumented functions in ``ImageOps`` were deprecated in Pillow 4.3.0 (2017-10)
and have now been removed: ``gaussian_blur``, ``gblur``, ``unsharp_mask``, ``usm`` and
``box_blur``. Use the equivalent operations in ``ImageFilter`` instead.

6.0.0, they issue a ``DeprecationWarning``:
