ImageDraw arc, chord and pieslice can now use floats
----------------------------------------------------

There is no longer a need to ensure that the start and end arguments for `arc`,
`chord` and `pieslice` are integers.

Note that these numbers are not simply rounded internally, but are actually
utilised in the drawing process.

Consistent multiline text spacing
---------------------------------

When using the ImageDraw multiline methods, the spacing between lines was
inconsistent, based on the combination on ascenders and descenders.

This has now been fixed, so that lines are offset by their baselines, not the
absolute height of each line.

There is also now a default spacing of 4px between lines.
