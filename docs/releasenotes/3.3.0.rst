3.3.0
-----

Libimagequant support
=====================

There is now support for using libimagequant as a higher quality
quantization option in ``Image.quantize()`` on Unix-like
platforms. This support requires building Pillow from source against
libimagequant. We cannot distribute binaries due to licensing
differences.

New Setup.py options
====================

There are two new options to control the ``build_ext`` task in ``setup.py``:

  * ``--debug`` dumps all of the directories and files that are
    checked when searching for libraries or headers when building the
    extensions.
  * ``--disable-platform-guessing`` removes many of the directories
    that are checked for libraries and headers for build systems or
    cross compilers that specify that information in via environment
    variables.


Image Metadata
==============

The return type for binary data in version 2 Exif and Tiff metadata
has been changed from a tuple of integers to bytes. This is a change
from the behavior since ``3.0.0``.
