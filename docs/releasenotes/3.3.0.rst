Libimagequant support
=====================

There is now support for using libimagequant as a higher quality
quantization option in ``Image.quantize()`` on Unix-like
platforms. This support requires building Pillow from source against
libimagequant. We cannot distribute binaries due to licensing
differences.

New Setup.py options
====================

There are three new options to control the ``build_ext`` task in ``setup.py``:

  * ``--debug`` dumps all of the directories and files that are
    checked when searching for libraries or headers when building the
    extensions.
  * ``--disable-platform-guessing`` removes many of the directories
    that are checked for libraries and headers for build systems or
    cross compilers that specify that information in via environment
    variables.
  * ``--disable-osx-tcltk-framework`` prevents automatically linking
    against the system Tcl/Tk frameworks to allow building against
    vendor-provided libraries.
