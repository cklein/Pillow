4.2.0
-----

Added Complex Text Rendering
============================

Pillow now supports complex text rendering for scripts requiring glyph
composition and bidirectional flow. This optional feature adds three
dependencies: harfbuzz, fribidi, and raqm. See the install
documentation for further details. This feature is tested and works on
Unix and Mac, but has not yet been built on Windows platforms.

Removed Deprecated Items
========================

Several deprecated items have been removed.

* The methods :py:meth:`PIL.ImageWin.Dib.fromstring`,
  :py:meth:`PIL.ImageWin.Dib.tostring` and
  :py:meth:`PIL.TiffImagePlugin.ImageFileDirectory_v2.as_dict` have
  been removed.

* Before Pillow 4.2.0, attempting to save an RGBA image as JPEG would
  discard the alpha channel. From Pillow 3.4.0, a deprecation warning
  was shown. From Pillow 4.2.0, the deprecation warning is removed and
  an :py:exc:`IOError` is raised.
