New DDS Image Plugins
=====================

The `DdsImagePlugin` reading DXT1 and DXT5 encoded .dds images was
added. DXT3 images are not currently supported.

Updates to the GbrImagePlugin
=============================

The `GbrImagePlugin` (GIMP brush format) has been updated to fix
support for version 1 files and add support for version 2 files.

Passthrough Parameters for ImageDraw.text
=========================================

`ImageDraw.multiline_text` and `ImageDraw.multiline_size` take extra
spacing paramaters above what are used in `ImageDraw.text` and
`ImageDraw.size`. These parameters can now be passed into
`ImageDraw.text` and `ImageDraw.size` and they will be passed through
to the corresponding multiline functions.

ImageSequence.Iterator changes
==============================

`ImageSequence.Iterator` is now an actual iterator implementating the
Iterator protocol.  It is also now possible to seek to the first image
of the file when using direct indexing.
