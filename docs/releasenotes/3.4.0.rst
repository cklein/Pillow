New resizing filters
====================

Two new filters available for ``Image.resize()`` and ``Image.thumbnail()``
functions: ``BOX`` and ``HAMMING``. ``BOX`` is the high-performance filter with
two times shorter window than ``BILINEAR``. It can be used for image reduction
3 and more times and produces a more sharp result than ``BILINEAR``.

``HAMMING`` filter has the same performance as ``BILINEAR`` filter while
providing the image downscaling quality comparable to ``BICUBIC``.
Both new filters don't show good quality for the image upscaling.


Append images to GIF
====================

Additional frames can now be appended when saving a GIF file, through the
``append_images`` argument. The new frames are passed in as a list of images,
which may be have multiple frames themselves.

Note that the ``append_images`` argument is only used if ``save_all`` is also
in effect, e.g.::

    im.save(out, save_all=True, append_images=[im1, im2, ...])
