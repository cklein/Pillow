New resizing filters
====================

Two new filters available for ``Image.resize()`` and ``Image.thumbnail()``
functions: ``BOX`` and ``HAMMING``. ``BOX`` is the high-performance filter with
two times shorter window than ``BILINEAR``. It can be used for image reduction
3 and more times and produces a more sharp result than ``BILINEAR``.

``HAMMING`` filter has the same performance as ``BILINEAR`` filter while
providing the image downscaling quality comparable to ``BICUBIC``.
Both new filters don't show good quality for the image upscaling.
