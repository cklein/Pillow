API Changes
===========

Allow saving of zero quality JPEG images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If no quality was specified when saving a JPEG, Pillow internally used a value
of zero to indicate that the default quality should be used. However, this
removed the ability to actually save a JPEG with zero quality. This has now
been resolved.

.. code-block:: python

    from PIL import Image
    im = Image.open("hopper.jpg")
    im.save("out.jpg", quality=0)

Improved APNG support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added support for reading and writing Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) images.
The PNG plugin now supports using the :py:meth:`~PIL.Image.Image.seek` method and the
:py:class:`~PIL.ImageSequence.Iterator` class to read APNG frame sequences.
The PNG plugin also now supports using the ``append_images`` argument to write APNG frame
sequences. See :ref:`apng-sequences` for further details.
