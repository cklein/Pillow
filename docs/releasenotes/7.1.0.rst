API Changes
===========

Improved APNG support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added support for reading and writing Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) images.
The PNG plugin now supports using the :py:meth:`~PIL.Image.Image.seek` method and the
:py:class:`~PIL.ImageSequence.Iterator` class to read APNG frame sequences.
The PNG plugin also now supports using the ``append_images`` argument to write APNG frame
sequences. See :ref:`apng-sequences` for further details.
