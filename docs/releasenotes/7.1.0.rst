Allow saving of zero quality JPEG images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If no quality was specified when saving a JPEG, Pillow internally used a value
of zero to indicate that the default quality should be used. However, this
removed the ability to actually save a JPEG with zero quality. This has now
been resolved.

.. code-block:: python

    from PIL import Image
    im = Image.open("hopper.jpg")
    im.save("out.jpg", quality=0)
