API Changes
===========

Allow saving of zero quality JPEG images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If no quality was specified when saving a JPEG, Pillow internally used a value
of zero to indicate that the default quality should be used. However, this
removed the ability to actually save a JPEG with zero quality. This has now
been resolved.

.. code-block:: python

    from PIL import Image
    im = Image.open("hopper.jpg")
    im.save("out.jpg", quality=0)

API Additions
=============

Reading JPEG comments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When opening a JPEG image, the comment may now be read into
:py:attr:`~PIL.Image.Image.info`.

Other Changes
=============

If present, only use alpha channel for bounding box
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the :py:meth:`~PIL.Image.Image.getbbox` method calculates the bounding
box, for an RGB image it trims black pixels. Similarly, for an RGBA image it
would trim black transparent pixels. This is now changed so that if an image
has an alpha channel (RGBA, RGBa, PA, LA, La), any transparent pixels are
trimmed.

Improved APNG support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added support for reading and writing Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) images.
The PNG plugin now supports using the :py:meth:`~PIL.Image.Image.seek` method and the
:py:class:`~PIL.ImageSequence.Iterator` class to read APNG frame sequences.
The PNG plugin also now supports using the ``append_images`` argument to write APNG frame
sequences. See :ref:`apng-sequences` for further details.
